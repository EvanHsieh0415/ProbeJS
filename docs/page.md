This wiki contains the documentation for the ProbeJS mod. ProbeJS is a KubeJS addon that allows the dynamic generation of `typings` that can be used by IDEs like VSCode to provide better autocompletion and type checking for KubeJS scripts.

For installation instructions, see the [Installation](./installation/page.md) page. Also check out other pages for more information on how to use ProbeJS.

Current wiki is targeting ProbeJS version 7.0.0, which is a deeply rewritten version of ProbeJS. Most of the feature described here might not be available in older versions. If you are using an older version of ProbeJS, consider updating to the latest version.
